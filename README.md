## Executive Summary

**Do you have any ideas on climate change and how it affects your business?** Climate change is the long-term alteration of temperature and typical weather patterns in a place. The main reason behind this change is the emission of excess amounts of greenhouse gases which causes global warming. One of the most adverse effects of global warming is **rising sea levels.**

The change in sea level includes risks such as frequent floods in coastal areas where your business might be located. It also affects oil and gas companies that deal with offshore oil rigs. It will have its worst effects on commercial fishing and insurance companies. All you need is to have a better knowledge of your business locations which are nearby coastal areas. This will prevent you from huge losses.

The challenge is, how to know the sea level of your business location. It can be gathered from tide stations and satellite data. **How to get that data? How to predict the change in sea level?**

**Sit back and relax!** There is always a solution. The best possible way to predict sea-level change is to study the patterns in the past and the patterns in similar and nearby locations. As an oil and gas company, you should set up your offshore rigs in a resourceful place where there will be no significant change in sea level to affect the process in a long time. To achieve this, we built a machine learning model which uses the Random Forest Model that gives a RMSE (root mean square error) of 193.00 cm. 

Now you have greatly minimized your loss due to natural causes. This will increase the trust among the shareholders and keep the company in a better position in the market.

We love to collaborate with an esteemed organization like yours. We will help you to minimize the risks caused by sea-level change at your business location.
**The Ocean goes up and down, but your Business never goes down!**
